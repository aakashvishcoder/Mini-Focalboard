# Mini Focalboard

## General Process

Trello and other websites use focalboards to organize their tasks into structured blocks. This project could be seen as as a more structured version of a to-do list, and to that front I agree. If you couldn't already tell, I took deep inspiration from websites such as trello or clickup. Using their structures, I was able to make my own version.

To create this project, I first defined the tech stack. At the beginning of this project, I used TypeScript in order to create the focalboard, but unfortunately I was having issues running the code, and switched to the React framework instead. Using Mongoose and MongoDB, I saved the user's information to the database for future use. Additionally, instead of using vannila CSS I attempted to learn tailwind CSS and use it in this project. Although the GUI is very simple/minimalistic, through this I was able to learn how to use tailwind to create the CSS components without writing any code in CSS.
