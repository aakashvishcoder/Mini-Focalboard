# Mini Focalboard

## General Process

Trello and other websites use focalboards to organize their tasks into structured blocks. This project could be seen as as a more structured version of a to-do list, and to that front I agree. If you couldn't already tell, I took deep inspiration from websites such as trello or clickup. Using their structures, I was able to make my own version.

To create this project, I first defined the tech stack.
